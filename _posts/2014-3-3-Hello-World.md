title: WPF app in C# 
In this tutorial, i will share my experience about creating an application in **WPF** using C# which creates rectangle, circle and triangle with given input parameters.

## What actually is WPF ?
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), a UI framework that is resolution-independent and uses a vector-based rendering engine, built to take advantage of modern graphics hardware. WPF provides a comprehensive set of application-development features that include Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML), controls, data binding, layout, 2D and 3D graphics, animation, styles, templates, documents, media, text, and typography. WPF is part of .NET, so you can build applications that incorporate other elements of the .NET API.
